TODO:

- Introduce 'Question' model with episode_id(answer), a question, and a red herring answer 
- Fill in gaps in the database where we have missing images
- Re-style front page, remove background tiled images, add a nav bar, add bootstrap
- Tune out duplicate images on the front page
- Write a script for ripping all the images from our remote locations
- Have a form for users to submit a question, have an is_approved boolean on the question to prevent the
  question page being filled up with junk
- Get it up on Heroku

IDEAS:

- Transferable to South Park or Adventure Time or any other cartoon / TV show.
